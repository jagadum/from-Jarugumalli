Did you know bees have to visit about two million flowers for just one pound of honey? Yep, those little buzzers work really hard! They zip around collecting nectar from lots of flowers. Then, back in the hive, the nectar turns into the yummy honey we enjoy. Bees are like nature's super-busy chefs!![](NuthanJarugumalli.jpg)
